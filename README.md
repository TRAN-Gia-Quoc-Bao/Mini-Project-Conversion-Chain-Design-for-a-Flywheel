# Mini-project: Conversion chain design for a flywheel
This mini-project is part of my Mechatronics course, done in a group of three students. It concerns control of a flywheel using the Park transformation, a three-phase to two-phase transformation in synchronous machine analysis.

It was conducted entirely in French, but the comments in my codes are in English.
