# Mini-project: Conversion chain design for a flywheel
This mini-project is part of my Mechatronics course, done in a group of three students. It concerns control of a flywheel for energy stocking using the Park transformation, a three-phase to two-phase transformation in synchronous machine analysis. 

More about this transformation is found at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/parks-transformation.

The project was conducted entirely in French. The comments in my codes are in English.
